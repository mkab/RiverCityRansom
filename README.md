# RiverCityRansom
A project in the software engineering course, Design-by-contract programming, at University of Pierre Marie Curie

Design the game River City Ransom using the principles design by contract. The game’s concept is as follows: 

1.	Two playable characters Ryan and Alex that can move in four directions (left, right, up, and down), jump in any of the four directions, pick up an object or a character, throw the object or the character, land a punch on a character. The characters are either Ryan, Alex, or an evil gangster.

2.	Gangsters have more or less limited capacity compared to Ryan and Alex.

3.	The playground of the game is made up of different types of graphic blocks:
  •	Empty blocks that can be walked on freely by any character.
  •	Blocks-ditch where walking on it may be fatal.
  •	Blocks containing objects in which we can still move freely.

4.	Different type of objects exists in the game: 
  •	Reusable objects, such as brooms, bicycle chains, baseball bat, that any character can pick up (very useful for fighting)
  •	Objects with a market value that can be resold or used in a shop in order to buy a variety of wonderful objects (health, objects).



The aim of the project is to: 


•	Provide a complete specification of the game model (for each character, item etc…) in the specification language discussed in class.

•	Achieve from the specification a contract document. Create different user case scenarios with preconditions, post conditions and invariants.

•	Implement the game model in Java while respecting the contract document previously created.

•	Create a list of test objectives and implement these test using JUnit.

•	Create two complete versions of the game, a totally bugged game and a bug-free game. 

•	Collect error messages during when executing the buggy version with the specified tests.
